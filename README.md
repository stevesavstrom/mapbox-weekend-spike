# Weekend Spike: MapBox

In preparation for the Prime Solo Project, I am working on a weekend spike to learn a new feature that I will add to my application. I am learning more about MapBox and how to create an interactice, searchable map with informational markers.

Starting with this tutorial: [Use Mapbox GL JS in a React app](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/use-mapbox-gl-js-with-react/)

## To Do

- [x] Setup new React App folder structure.
- [x] Create MapBox account and create Access Token.
- [x] Create index.html page
- [x] Create the React App in index.js
- [x] Add Mapbox GL JS in App.js
- [x] Set App.js default state (which city you want to default to).
- [x] Render the map in the return on App.js
- [x] Style viewport size
- [x] Create function to store new coordinates as user scrolls and zooms.
- [x] Display the coordinates in sidebar on DOM.
